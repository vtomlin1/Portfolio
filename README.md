# Hello! My name is Tori Tomlinson   
Feel free to contact me at either my gmail vtomlin315@gmail.com or my linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-tomlinson-4ba316240!   
--- 
I am an aspiring Data Analyst. 

## Skills  
---
**Communication** - I have worked in groups and shared code for class assignments. I have also worked in sales and customer satisfaction. 

**Technical** - I have beginner experience with Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel.  

## Education   
---
I have a bachelors of science in Applied Mathematics from UC Davis. 

During my time at UC Davis, I took courses in Real Analysis and Numerical Analysis that taught me mathematical logic and problem solving. These classes were also quite challenging, so I often worked within groups to solve many challenges and seeked out many resources on my own to solve many problems.  
### Certifications
---
After I graduated, I took some online courses through UC Davis Coursera.

I took a course in **Visual Analytics in Tableau**. I created many different styles of graphs to visualize data in a simple yet effective way. I also made interactive dashboards where end users can find more information from areas of interest. I have uploaded a few visualizations on a public profile which is all here: [TableauProfile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/victoria.tomlinson/vizzes). 

The other course that I took was **SQL for Data Science**.
I learned the basics of SQL and simple quieries. I have worked with a sample database called the Chinook database to extract data and transform the data into a table that displays relevant data to answer many example questions.  

## Extra-Curricular  
---
- I was a member of math club at UC Davis. I attended some workshops and math challenges within teams.   
- I attended many workshops at HackDavis in 2023 to explore many different programming languages such as HTML, Javascript, and React. Worked with a small team to follow different workshops for a whole week.
- I participated in hacking weeks in Major Hacking League and attended many data workshops. Mostly exploring data science and machine learning algorithms.  
## Projects

### SQL Sakila 
---
The Sakila database (version 1.3) is a free database that I have worked with to practice MySQL.  
Below is the EER diagram for the Sakila Database.

```sql
SELECT
    CONCAT('$',amount) AS 'Payment Amount',
    DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, "%d/%m/%Y") AS 'Payment Date'
FROM payment LIMIT 20;
```
